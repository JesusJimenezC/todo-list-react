# Todo List Aplication

This is a simple todo list application that uses the following technologies:
- React
- useReducer (as state management)

I build an application using that technologies to learn how to use them and how to implement a small state management without use Redux or any other similar state manager from third parties.

## How to run
```javascript
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## How to build
```javascript
pnpm build
```
